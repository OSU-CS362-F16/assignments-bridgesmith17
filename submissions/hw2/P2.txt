I was unable to produce the error as described in the prompt. I wanted to test each method individually and focus on the functionality that wasn’t built in to the Java language .  I first wanted to look at the Card Class. I focused on the constructor and creation of the protodeck since the error we are worried about is the card becoming out of order. All cards are added to the protodeck correctly , the constructor works as expected and the visibility works as expected. I then looked at the card collection class. I tested the constructor and it worked as expected. When I tested the get cards class it returned the card in the order they were added. The add all function works as expected. The discardCard function works as expected to and shifts the rest of the deck  up to its new position. So cards couldn’t become out of order by getting added to the wrong position in the collection.  There anything in either class that I can see that would cause the cards to become out of order besides the permute function.
